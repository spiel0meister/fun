# Fun
Fun is a programming language written in Rust and meant as an experimental project.

For any questions regarding the syntax see the [docs](docs/intro.md).

# Setup

Firstly, download the compiler from the releases, create a file with a .fun extension, and execute the following command while being in the directory of the compiler:
```bash
./fun foo.fun
```

If you get and error, try making the file executable:
```bash
chmod +x fun
```
